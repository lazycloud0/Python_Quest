Python Quest: The Enchanted Forest
an interactive workshop that introduces basic Python concepts

This workshop covers the following Python concepts:

1. Variables and data types (strings, integers)
2. Input/output operations
3. Conditional statements (if/else)
4. Loops (while loops)
5. Functions
6. Lists and random selection
7. Importing and using modules (random)
8. String methods (lower())
9. Basic arithmetic operations
10. Comparison operators
11. Boolean logic

Here's how to conduct the workshop:

1. Introduction (5-10 minutes):

   - Briefly explain the basic Python concepts that will be covered.
   - Introduce the game concept and explain that they'll be learning Python by creating and playing this game.

2. Code Walkthrough (20-30 minutes):

   - Go through the code section by section, explaining the concepts and how they're applied in the game.
   - Encourage questions and discussion about each part of the code.

3. Hands-on Coding (30-40 minutes):

   - Have bootcampers type out the code in their own Python environment.
   - Assist with any syntax errors or questions that arise.

4. Playtesting and Modifications (20-30 minutes):

   - Let bootcampers play their game a few times.
   - Encourage them to modify aspects of the game, such as:
     - Adding new encounters or riddles
     - Changing the health mechanics
     - Adding new player actions
     - Modifying the win/lose conditions

5. Sharing and Discussion (10-15 minutes):

   - Have bootcampers share their modifications and experiences.
   - Discuss how the Python concepts were applied in creating the game.

6. Wrap-up and Q&A (5-10 minutes):
   - Summarize the Python concepts learned.
   - Answer any remaining questions.
   - Suggest resources for further learning.

This workshop provides a fun, interactive way for beginners to apply basic Python concepts in a practical context. It encourages creativity and problem-solving while introducing fundamental programming principles.
